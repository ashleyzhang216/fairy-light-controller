# fairy-light-controller

Code, CAD, and design files for a fairy light controller.

I had some string lights that I liked but were powered through USB-A and had to be plugged in and unplugged to turn on and off. 

This circuit board houses a large, illuminated button (SV8FW3SS-601) to toggle the fairy lights. 

It also has another button to toggle onboard LEDs, which act as a nightlight. 

An input USB-A cable is used to provide power to the fairy lights through a second USB port. A third port is also added, passing data and power, for personal convenience.
